CRUD bank app with option to add accounts, delete accounts, and deposit or withdrawl funds. Complete with unit tests, Swagger web UI and setup for creating a database for the program.

Note: You will have to setup your own mySQL server to run this program and add an appsettings.json file with this paramater 
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "serverConnection": "server=localhost;user={yourUserGoesHere};password={yourPasswordGoesHere};database={theDatabaseNameThatWillBeGenerated};
  }

  Once this is in place run "update database" in your package manager console and the program should now work and be connected to your DB.
